- [ ] Very nice figure. (referring to Figure 1.4). Can you please indicate the length scale and density colormap (the colormap is given in the animation)?
- [ ] Maybe it is worth to make a fit to this figure and figure 4.5. There are clear trends, as the text says. (referring to Figures 4.4 and 4.5)
- [ ] One large colorbar would have been better than nine miniature ones (referring to Figure 4.9).
- [ ] These two lines look the same. Can one of them be dashed? (referring to Figure 4.12).
- [ ] No need to show t<0 (referring to Figure 4.12)
- [ ] I suggest starting the figures at t=0 (referring to Figure 1 in Chapter 5).
