| Amit Kashi    | 1                     | The difference between the introduction chapter and the theoretical background chapter is not clear. I think they can be merged to one chapter (unless this is a dictated format).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Chapter 1 gives a description of the common envelope interactions, starting from a brief explanation of the single stellar evolution, then into binary interactions and finally tacking the generalities of common envelopes from an astrophysical point of view. The last section of this Chapter contains a list of the aims of the PhD research. Conversely, Chapter 2 gives a general description of the numerical methods used to analyse non-trivial hydrodinamical systems, which includes some models of common envelope interactions. While these two Chapters are related, their purposes are fundamentally different and, as such, cannot be merged without breaking the intended structure of the thesis. | 1                             |

What are the differences?<br>If it's not too much work, maybe show it on Fig 1.1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | I have included the main differences between AGB. super-AGB and extreme-AGB in the text.

First, a different M1 requires evolve the isolated model from scratch, including the mapping into the Phantom code and numerical relaxation, which may take a few months to be done. Additionally, the common envelope simulation will require a similar amount of time to be finished. The amount of work compared to the results we may obtain for a publication makes this task not worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 57                            |

So far the conclusion that the maximum exists hangs on one point (referring to sentence in Section 4.2: This suggest the existence of a mass ratio value 0.55 <q_opt < 0.78, for which the efficiency<br>of the early, dynamical envelope unbinding is maximum.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | As mentioned previously, additional simulations would take months.

While an opacity post-processing analysis is possible, the approach we made in Chapter 5 is more sophisticated since it includes the dynamical effects of the dust condensation in the envelope. We actually included opacity rendering in Chapter 5, but for a model with dust-driven acceleration from the beginning of the common envelope interaction.

| Amit Kashi    | 77                    | This point seems to need more attention. There should be a way to calibrate the softening length so it does not affect the results. (referring to sentence in Section 4.6: Larger softening lengths around the primary’s core increase stability, thereby extending the ROLF phase.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | I added a subsequent point in the document which satisfies this comment: The selection of the smallest value possible of softening length in SPH simulations is preferred, since it improves the resolution in the central region of the donor star. However, this is at the cost of wall-clock time of the calculations and the possible appearance of numerical instabilities in the star. This leads to find an optimal value of softening length in each simulation, depending on the available computational resources and the intended area of analysis i.e., more resolution near the core or in the envelope.                                                                                                 | 77                            |

There is a second part of this work, which was submitted after the submission of this thesis, This second dust paper implements the nucleation formulation described by Siess et al 2022 and  Gail & Sedlmayr (2013). This formulation uses the evolution of moments of the grain size distribution and it is a more sophisticated model of dust in the common envelope simulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 84                            |

| Amit Kashi    | 87                    | This is exactly related to my suggestion the previous chapter - to use the opacity when calculating how the simulation looks from different viewing angles (referring to Figure 2 in Chapter 5)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Nothing, as the reviewer is not asking to correct anything in this comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 87                            |
| Amit Kashi    | 89                    | Again, I would add to the discussion that other models claim that the importance of recombination is questionable (referring to sentence in Chapter 5: Recombination energy masks the relatively small effect of the dust-driven wind acceleration, because the thermal energy deposited in the gas by recombination already produces relatively large accelerations).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | This has now been added in compliance of the original comment regarding this issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 89                            |
| Amit Kashi    | 91                    | Now I understand why you think 10^6 is a good resolution. It is not, as I explained in an earlier comment (though it looks sufficient from looking at your figures). You use only one node, as your code most likely have no MPI capabilities.<br>While I understand the limitation, I don't think the statements regarding high resolution is correct.<br>I can also suggest using a node with more cores.

However, remaking the simulations shown in this work, even with an enhanced speed, would take months to implement and analyse. We are currently working on the nucleation prescription, which is more sophisticated and promising line of work than the Bowen prescription, at the cost of ~50% more wall-clock time of computation calculations. All these factor needs to be considered for future projects.                                                                                                                                                                               | 91                            |

| Mark Krumholz | 2                     | The candidate says “material starts accumulating in the disk and becomes optically thick, at which point the system becomes a T Tauri star”. This is confused on a couple of levels. First of all, the disk is much more massive and optically thick during the earlier phases than it is during this phase, contrary to what this phrasing implies. Second, the properties of the star do not change significantly during this phase – it does not “become” a T Tauri star. I suspect that the source of both confusions is the candidate not quite realising that the distinctive thing about the fourth phase is that enough of the envelope has been cleared that for the first time the star and the disc become directly visible in NIR or optical, whereas previously they were obscured by the envelope. It’s not that the star was somehow different in the earlier phase and only becomes a T Tauri star during this phase, it’s that the observational definition of a T Tauri star is based on the presence of certain features in the stellar spectrum, and during earlier phases the star is not visible and thus you can’t take the spectrum you would need in order to classify it as T Tauri. Similarly, it is not that the disc becomes optically thick during this phase, it is that this is the first phase when you can see the disc at all in NIR or optical.                                      | I edited this sentence to specify that the T Tauri star in an observational definition and removed all mentions of an optically thick disk to avoid confusion in the text.

| Mark Krumholz | 2                     | The candidate then goes on to say “the spectral energy distribution will have a distinct appearance depending on whether the disk is just absorbing the inner radiation and re-emitting it or whether it is massive enough to accrete material”. The phrase “massive enough to accrete material” makes it sound like the key question is whether material is accreting onto the disc from outside, but this is incorrect – the key question is whether material is accreting from the disc onto the star. The reason this matters for the SED is that, if the disc is accreting onto the star, then the gravitational potential energy released by the accretion flow heats the disc, giving it a different temperature structure than a passively-illuminated disc.

| Mark Krumholz | 2                     | Section 1.1, 2nd paragraph: the candidate says “As helium possesses a higher density compared to hydrogen, it sinks towards the center, gradually accumulating and forming a core predominantly composed of inert helium where fusion reactions do not occur.” This is again a confusion. Settling of helium basically never an important effect – the molecular diffusion time in a stellar core is usually longer than the Hubble time. The reason that an inert He core builds up in the centre is simply that the nuclear burning rate is highest in the centre, so that is where the H is fully converted to He earliest. Sinking is unimportant.

| Mark Krumholz | 30                    | Section 2.2.1, under “Ideal gas with radiation pressure”: the description of radiation pressure given here, “the luminosity of the gas emitted as a black body in the for of radiation pressure”, is confused. (There is also a typo – for instead of form – but that’s not the important bit.) Radiation pressure is not a luminosity; those two concepts are not related and have different units. Radiation pressure in a very optically thick system (which is implicitly being assumed here) is exactly like gas pressure: to define gas pressure, one imagines placing an infinitesimal piece of gas in a box with perfectly reflecting walls and measuring outward momentum per unit time per unit area imparted to the walls when atoms in the gas bounce of them. Radiation pressure is the exact same thing, except for photons instead of atoms. If the gas and radiation field are in local thermodynamic equilibrium, then one can express the photon energy distribution in terms of the temperature T (which in LTE is the same for gas and radiation), and equation 2.53 follows from this. Please rewrite the explanation of radiation pressure to remove the confusion and its relationship with luminosity, and please make it clear that equation 2.53 is applicable only to optically thick systems in LTE (which is fine for this thesis, since stellar interiors generally fit that description). | Fixed. I have edited this section and removed all ambiguity between gas and radiation pressures, including a change of the title to "Ideal gas plus radiation pressure" to indicate that the radiation pressure is added into the original equation of state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 28 and 29                     |
| Mark Krumholz | 30                    | The more significant issue is that the candidate seems a bit confused about why tabulated equations of state are needed. He says that they are needed because “the free electrons start to recombine and emit ionisation photons”, which seems to imply that photon emission is the key process. It is not, and in fact several of the EOS regions shown in figure 2.3 where one cannot assume an ideal gas have nothing whatsoever to do with ionisation. The key point here is that the ideal equation of state is derived under two assumptions that fail at high temperature and density: (1) that the number of free particles per unit mass is a conserved quantity, and (2) that interparticle forces are negligible except over very short periods of time when particles undergo collisions. Assumption (1) can be violated by ionisation, but it can also be violated by the presence of photons (which are bosons, hence not conserved), and by electron-positron pair production. Assumption (2) is violated once Coulomb forces between particles are significant, which is for example what the PC EoS is trying to capture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Figure 2.3 indicates the type of tabulated equation of state that is used in different combinations of densities and temperatures.

| Mark Krumholz | 30                    | Section 2.2.1, under “Recombination energy”: there are a couple of confusions in the discussion here that should be fixed. The first is minor: the candidate says “if the gas is fully ionised and in thermodynamic equilibrium, photons are constantly being emitted and absorbed by the electrons”, which is not quite correct because electrons alone neither emit nor absorb photons; pure photon-electron interactions can only be scattering. Emission and absorption happen only in the presence of ions. This can be fixed just by changing “emitted and absorbed by electrons” to “emitted and absorbed by the plasma”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Fixed, I adopted the reviewer's suggestion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 30                            |
| Mark Krumholz | 59                    | It would be helpful to add some commentary on why Mub,p behaves non-monotonically with q. Is this related somehow to the structure of the donor star, and which layers of that star the companion is interacting with for different q? Would you expect it to be different for donor stars or different structure or mass? It would be good to add some thoughts on this, since it is a surprising result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | We have added an explanation for this behaviour and answered the reviewer's question in the conclusions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 60 and 77                     |
| Mark Krumholz | 66                    | the term q_opt is introduced in the last paragraph of this section, but never defined. I’m guessing this is 0.55, about the value found to be most efficient at ejecting the envelope. Assuming this is correct, then section 4.3 would also greatly benefit from some discussion of why this particular value of q is special.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The q_opt is not 0.55, but is in the range [0.55,0.77], we have modified the text and made this mathematical definition clear, as illustrated in Equation 4.3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 60 and 77                     |
| Mark Krumholz | 76                    | The candidate has done a lot of experimenting with the effects of the softening length in particular, but I am a bit uncertain as to what conclusion I should be drawing from all of this. Is the correct conclusion that the second rapid unbinding phase is entirely numerical and should therefore be disregarded as a numerical artefact? Or is there a real second rapid unbinding phase, but its properties are not converged at the currently available simulation resolutions? This seems like an important and fundamental distinction, but the candidate never really gets to this question. <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | I have added a point in the conclusions addressing this comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 78                            |

In 3D simulations, this is roughly the same as doubling the resolution of the model, which is, in general, considered the minimum increment accepted for resolution tests. Intermediate resolution are normally ignored or disregard by referees in publications. Moreover, they take around a month to be finished, which is a  considerable amount of computational time used in a typical granted PC time. An intermediate resolution, such as the ones implemented in Chapter 4, is acceptable because the scope of them is beyond a resolution test.                                                    | 76                            |
